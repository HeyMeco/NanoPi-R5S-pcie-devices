# Rockchip-pcie-devices
Inspired by @geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices for Rockchip SoC's.

## This is a public effort to document PCI-E Device support for Rockchip based (Single Board) Computers
**Contributions are Welcome!**

I only have the NanoPi R5S currently so I can only contribute for RK3568.

Soon there will be results added for RK3588 with the Radxa Rock 5B.
