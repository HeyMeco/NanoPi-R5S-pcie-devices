# Rockchip-pcie-devices
Inspired by @geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices for Rockchip SoC's.

## This is a public effort to document PCI-E Device support for Rockchip based (Single Board) Computers
**Contributions are Welcome!**

My tests are done on:
| SoC  |  Board |

| RK3568  | FriendlyElec NanoPi R5S |
